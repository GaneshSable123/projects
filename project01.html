                <h2>Father Of Constitution</h2>
                <p> <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>(14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist,
                    social reformer and political leader who headed the
                    committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law
                    and Justice minister
                    in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing
                    Hinduism.

                    After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at
                    Columbia University and
                    the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a
                    handful of Indian
                    students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also trained in the law at
                    Gray's Inn, London. In
                    his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his
                    political activities; he
                    became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating
                    political rights and
                    social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he
                    converted to
                    Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.[14]
